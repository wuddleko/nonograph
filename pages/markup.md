Nonograph supports a lot of concise markup options to make pages fun and expressive. It's a dialect of markdown focused on speed and literal input.

You can append `.md` to any page to get the raw markdown. Great for copying styles that you like from others pages!

## Text Formatting
```md
**bold**
```
**Wrap text with single asterisks**

```md
*italic*
```
*Wrap text with double asterisks*

```md
_underline_
```
_Wrap text with underscores_

```md
~strikethrough~
```
~Wrap text with tildes~

```md
^superscript^
```
You can^Wrap text with carets^ to make it ^superscript!^

```md
==highlight==
```
==Wrap text with double equals==

```md
`inline code`
```
`Wrap text with backticks`

## Headings
```md
# Heading 1
```

# Large heading

```md
## Heading 2
```

## Medium heading

```md
### Heading 3
```

### Small heading

```md
#### Heading 4
```

#### Smaller heading

## Blockquotes
```md
> This is a quoted text
```

> Creates an indented quote block

## Footnotes
**Reference footnotes** - mark position with `[^1]` and define at bottom:

```md
This has a footnote[^1] and another[^2].

[^1]: First footnote definition.
[^2]: Second footnote definition.
```

**Inline footnotes** - define directly in text:

```md
This has an inline footnote^[The footnote text goes here].
```

Like the markup you see in someone else's page? Append ".md" to the end of their URL to get the raw markdown!

## Links
```md
[link text](https://example.com)
```
[link text](https://example.com)

```md
[https://example.com]
```
[https://example.com]

## Media
### Images

```md
![Alt text](https://example.com/image.jpg)
```

When you include alt text, it becomes a caption below the image.

```md
![](https://example.com/image.png)
```

Images without alt text display with no caption.

Supported formats: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .webp

### Videos
Videos use the same syntax as images:

```md
![Video caption](https://example.com/video.mp4)
```
![Video caption](https://example.com/video.mp4)

When you include alt text, it becomes a centered caption below the video.

```md
![](https://example.com/video.webm)
```
![](https://example.com/video.webm)

Videos without alt text display with no caption.

Supported formats: .mp4, .webm, .ogg, .mov, .avi, .mkv

## Lists
### Bulleted Lists
```md
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
```

- First item
- Second item 
- Third item

You can use `-`, `*`, or `+` as bullet markers:

```md
* Item with asterisk
+ Item with plus
- Item with dash
```

* Item with asterisk
+ Item with plus
- Item with dash

### Numbered Lists
```md
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step
```

1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

### Lists with Formatting
All text formatting works inside lists:

```md
- This is **bold** text
- This is *italic* text
- This has `inline code`
- This has [a link](https://example.com)
```

- This is **bold** text
- This is *italic* text
- This has `inline code`
- This has [a link](https://example.com)

## Tables
```md
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   | Cell 3   |
| Data A   | Data B   | Data C   |
```

Like so:

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   | Cell 3   |
| Data A   | Data B   | Data C   |

Align columns with colons in separator row:
- `:---` Left align
- `:---:` Center align
- `---:` Right align

## Code Blocks
Use triple backticks for code blocks:

````md
```language
your code here
```
````

You can append a filetype immediately after the backticks (on the same line, no space) to tell the site what language you're using. Hover over the copy button to reveal it.

````md
```json
{
  "name": "nonograph",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "settings": {
    "debug": true,
    "port": 8080
  }
}
```
````
